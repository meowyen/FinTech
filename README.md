# Case Study: Square, Inc.

## Overview

[Square, Inc.](https://squareup.com/) is a technology company founded in 2009 by Jack Dorsey (currently Twitter's CEO) and Jim McKelvey. Square was originally a mobile payments and merchant services company but has expanded into other domains such as food delivery, web hosting and digital banking. It is now a publicly traded company ([NYSE: SQ](https://www.nyse.com/quote/XNYS:SQ)) processing billions of dollars in payment transactions.

> The idea came about because co-founder Jim McKelvey was unable to accept credit card payments for his high-end glass faucets and fittings.

## The Path to IPO

Square received initial funding from a number of notable investors and celebrities including Marissa Mayer (former Yahoo! CEO), Biz Stone (Twitter co-founder) and MC Hammer (American rapper).

### Pre-IPO Fundings
- Series A: $10 million in November 2009
- Series B: $27.5 million in January 2011
- Series C: $100 million in June 2011
- Series D: $200 million in September 2012
- Series E: $150 million in October 2014

The company debuted on the New York Stock Exchange ([NYSE: SQ](https://www.nyse.com/quote/XNYS:SQ)) in November 2015, trading at $9 per share with an initial valuation of $2.9 billion. As of November 2020, it is trading at $185 per share.

## A Tale of Two Ecosystems

Square's set of products is divided into two ecosystems, the Seller and the Cash App ecosystems. The Seller ecosystem is the suite of hardware and software that blends its managed payments and point of sale (POS) businesses. The Cash App ecosystem offers peer-to-peer money transfers, digital banking, and investing (stocks and bitcoin).

### The First of Many

Square's first product was a mobile credit card reader, a square device that plugged into and transmitted data through a smartphone's headphone jack. The device was compatible with both iOS and Android operating systems. These devices were first shipped in May 2010. This product offered small businesses and individuals an alternative to mainstream credit card processors. While the first reader was provided to vendors for free, each transaction processed was charged a small fee. Today, the standard fee is 2.6% + 10 cents per swipe or tap.

### The Modern Small Business

The Seller ecosystem, the larger of the two operations, is targeted towards business to consumer customers. With this suite of services, merchants can manage payments, invoicing, payroll, and customer engagement. This strategy not only locks in customers but helps with retention; Square can directly market to its existing customers.

The Cash App began as a simple money transfer mobile application where users can send money to another user using a unique username ($cashtag). It has since expanded to allow direct deposit, bitcoin trading and stock trading. Users are given two options when transferring money: standard or instant. Users are charged a fee for instant transfer; however, with a Cash Card users can avoid the transfer and spend the balance directly.

By integrating the two ecosystems, Square can sell to both businesses and their employees. Businesses or employers can encourage their employees to use the Cash App as an online bank. The Square Payroll system can direct deposit paychecks to the Cash App and employees can access their money instantly. This complete system is what sets Square apart from its competitors.

Additionally, the majority of its services are cloud-hosted solutions; Square leverages cloud technologies such as AWS Lambda and Kubernetes to build out and scale its services. The benefit of this is customers are able to use these services with little to no startup time.

## Competitors
